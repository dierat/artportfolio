# personal site

A simple personal site with an art portfolio and blog, made with Meteor.


# TODO

- figure out how to format blog posts with breaks between paragraphs (change content to an array instead of a string?)
- figure out how to show images in posts
- limit amount of post shown on main blog page to just a few lines
- get tags working, make them links that filter which posts are shown on the page
- add navigation between different areas of the site
- add security
- add links to twitter, github?
- add list of recent blog posts on the side?
